# UK-Census-data
The dataset consists of information of taken during a census of the population in United Kingdom with the purpose of comparing different people across the nation and for the government to make informed decisions using with accurate statistics of the population to enable better planning, to develop policies, and to allocate certain funding. The goal of this report is to clean and analyse the mock census data provided and make decisions on what to do with an unoccupied plot of land and what to invest in.
The study revealed the average age as 35 years with the minimum amd maximum ages being 0 and 106 years respectively. 25% of the population had ages 0-18 while 75% of the population are 18 years and above. The age pyramid showed a huge working class and a depleting old age group, hence the establishment of schools, banks or other organisations is vital. This can be complemented with construction of good network roads to link cities, and other social amentities.
